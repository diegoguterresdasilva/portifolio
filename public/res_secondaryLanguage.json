I currently work on the front-end with React framework (Javascript), on the back-end with Laravel framework (PHP) and on mobile with React Native. I worked for 10 years.

So I started to develop applications integrated to the ERP system, bringing more and more productivity and solutions. I am currently a systems analyst (developer), I use 'Monday/Jira' to create the project workflow of the current company. Being the focus on Laravel (PHP) backend and Jquery/ReactJS frontend.
